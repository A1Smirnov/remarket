# MERN E-Commerce Platform

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a fully functional e-commerce platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features user authentication, product browsing, a shopping cart, and a responsive design.

## 🔧 Features:
- User registration and login with secure authentication.
- Browse and search for products with detailed descriptions.
- Add products to a cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- Calculate the total cart value dynamically.
- Backend RESTful API to manage users, products, and carts.

## 🚀 Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React with Material UI for responsive design.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling.
- **State Management**: React Context API for managing global state.

## 📂 Project Structure:
- **Frontend (`frontend/src`)**:
  - `pages` — Application views (e.g., Home, Login, Cart).
  - `components` — Reusable UI components.
  - `context` — Application state management.
  - `theme` — Theme configuration for Material UI.
- **Backend (`backend`)**:
  - `routes` — API route handlers.
  - `models` — Mongoose data schemas.
  - `controllers` — Business logic for API endpoints.

## 📚 Getting Started:
### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB server set up locally or hosted on the cloud (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mern-ecommerce.git
   cd mern-ecommerce
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend && npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend && npm install
     ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-connection-string
     JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
     PORT=5000
     ```

4. Run the application:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend && npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend && npm start
     ```

5. Open the application:
   - Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the frontend.

## ✨ Future Enhancements:
- Add payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).
- Implement product reviews and ratings.
- Build an admin panel for managing users and products.
- Add advanced filtering and sorting for products.
- Enable multi-language support.
